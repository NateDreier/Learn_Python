# Learn Python 

Tryna learn some Python
files with AtBS == Automate the Boring Stuff
files with VP == Violent Python 

## notes

The goal of this is to get a better grasp on Python, learn best practices, formatting and more. I hope to improve my Python as well as git best practices, starting off with the README.

Adding a shebang `#!/usr/bin/python3.6` allows you to execute Python scripts in the cli.

Additionally, you need to make the script executable by running `chmod +x <fileName>`
