# Summary

Working on Code Cademy on the side to brush up coding basics, data structures and algorithms, and other pieces that I need to understand. 

Only some challenges will make it here since most can be done on their browser IDE. However, some challenges are large enough that I want to complete without any potential hints or helpers.

## Challenge 1

Figure out what the cheapest method to ship a package is. There are three methods to ship, ground, Drone and premium, each method has two different charges, a "price per pound" and a "flat rate" cost. Each method has a different value for the charges. 

This Program will determine which method, based on cost is the best way to ship.
