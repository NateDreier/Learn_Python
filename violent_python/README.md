# Things to improve:

## Chapter 1 - connect2socket
If running a scan against a range, add a block of code to see which IP addresses are able to be hit and which aren't. It would be nice to have that so that there are not a bunch of `[-] Error Timed out` errors.

Thinking about it though, what if the org blocks ICMP. Do I just need to suck it up and roll with a bunch of `[-] Error Timed out`'s?
